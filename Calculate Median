A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4  decimal places.

## This SQL Query for Even count using subquery
## Create two tables and checks if the count of number of lat less are equal to count of number of lat greater than the parent lat 

Select round(S.LAT_N,4) median from station S where (select count(Lat_N) from station where Lat_N < S.LAT_N ) = (select count(Lat_N) from station where Lat_N > S.LAT_N)

## Explanation :

## Beginning with the internal subquery â€“ the select assigns @rowindex as an incremental index for each distance that is selected and sorts the distance.
## Once we have the sorted list of distances, the outer query will fetch the middle items in the array. If the array contains an odd number of items, both values will be the single middle value.
## Then, the SELECT clause of the outer query returns the average of those two values as the median value.


SET @rowindex := 1;
Select ROUND(AVG(LAT_N),4) as Median FROM 
(select @rowindex := @rowindex+1 as rowindex, lat_n from STATION order by LAT_N) as ST1
where ST1.rowindex IN (FLOOR(@rowindex / 2), CEIL(@rowindex / 2));
