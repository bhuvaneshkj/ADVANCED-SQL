A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to 4  decimal places.

## This SQL Query for Even count using subquery
## Create two tables and checks if the count of number of lat less are equal to count of number of lat greater than the parent lat 

Select round(S.LAT_N,4) median from station S where (select count(Lat_N) from station where Lat_N < S.LAT_N ) = (select count(Lat_N) from station where Lat_N > S.LAT_N)
